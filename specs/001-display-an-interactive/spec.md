# Feature Specification: Interactive Vishnu Sahasranama with Parashara Bhatta's Commentary

**Feature Branch**: `001-display-an-interactive`  
**Created**: September 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Display an interactive Vishnu Sahasranama with Parashara Bhatta's commentary. Use-cases: - chanting: scroll through the shlokas - refer a word's meaning quickly - dive into Parashara's commentary - construct a prompt, asking about one of the words with its context- to be used in any LLM chat"


## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to interactively explore the Vishnu Sahasranama, chant the shlokas, quickly look up the meaning of any word, read Parashara Bhatta's commentary, and construct prompts for LLMs using contextual information about specific words.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user opens the interactive Vishnu Sahasranama, **When** they scroll through the shlokas, **Then** the text is displayed in a readable, sequential manner suitable for chanting.
2. **Given** a user selects or hovers over a word, **When** they request its meaning, **Then** the system displays the meaning and relevant commentary from Parashara Bhatta.
3. **Given** a user taps or hovers on a word, **When** the meaning or commentary is displayed, **Then** the word should remain in the same position and should not move or shift on the screen.
4. **Given** a user is viewing a word and its context, **When** they choose to construct a prompt, **Then** the system generates a context-rich prompt suitable for LLM input.

### Edge Cases
- All information (words, meanings, commentary) are static, so none of them would be missing at runtime.
- The information needs to be presentable both in landscape and portrait orientations


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to scroll through all shlokas of the Vishnu Sahasranama in order.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable users to select or highlight any word to view its meaning.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display Parashara Bhatta's commentary for each word or shloka, where available.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to construct a prompt for LLMs using a selected word and its context.
- **FR-005**: System MUST present the text in a format suitable for chanting (clear, sequential, readable).
- **FR-007**: System MUST be able to search for a word.
- **FR-008**: System MUST be hostable as a static site (e.g., GitHub Pages).
- **FR-009**: System MUST automate deployment to GitHub Pages using CI/CD (GitHub Actions workflow).
- **FR-010**: System SHOULD be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Key Entities
- **Shloka**: Represents a verse in the Vishnu Sahasranama; attributes: number, text, sequence.
- **Word**: Individual word within a shloka; attributes: text, position, meaning(s), commentary reference.
- **Commentary**: Parashara Bhatta's explanation for a word or shloka; attributes: text, associated word/shloka.
- **Prompt**: Contextual text constructed for LLM input; attributes: selected word, context, generated prompt.
